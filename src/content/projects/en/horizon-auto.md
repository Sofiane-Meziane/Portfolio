## Summary
Desktop software to manage a driving school with dedicated spaces for admins, secretaries, and instructors. Built with JavaFX and a strict MVC architecture.

## Approach
- JavaFX UI with role-based navigation.
- MVC separation of concerns for maintainability.
- MySQL database for persistent data storage.

## Results
Implemented workflows for admin, secretary, and instructor roles with a structured dashboard experience.
